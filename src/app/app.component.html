          The story of the computer is a long and storied one, with many twists and turns from its beginnings in the Cold War laboratories of the 1950’s, to its contemporary status as an indispensable system integral to everyone’s daily lives. Over this time period the computer has served a variety of purposes ranging from calculating ballistic missile tables for the military, serving as number crunchers for large businesses, and, more recently, as a person’s way of connecting to the internet from home. The confusing piece to this is the last step: what purpose did a number crunching, ballistic missile calculating machine serve in people’s homes? This question is easy to answer today, with the rise of the internet people are free to stay connected with loved ones, scour the web for any information or research they want to seek out, or work and learn remotely when the world suffers a pandemic. But with the rise of the internet not coming until the 1990’s, what was the original catalyst for bringing PC’s into the homes of people as opposed to businesses?

          Personally, I believe that the rise of user-friendly operating systems and GUIs was not only the catalyst that brought computers to the home user, but began the trend of integration of computers into people’s daily lives. This can be seen through the release of The “Trinity”, the time period that played host to the rise in operating systems and GUIs, as well as examining the consequences that followed. So, without further ado, let’s dive into how the personal computer got its start.

            The Trinity and early viability
          </span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest phases of computers, namely the research done during the 1950’s was limited to that of laboratories and universities. Most all computers that were created during this time were incredibly proprietary, prone to a lot of issues, were massive, expensive, and took trained professionals to operate. Not to mention they had little functionality beyond exactly what they were created to do, crunch numbers. It wasn’t until the end of the 1950’s and the beginning of the 1960’s that engineers began to focus on automating more tasks and building what would turn out to be the precursor to operating systems. Peter Denning does a great job of describing this in his article “50 Years of Operating Systems” as he describes The Great Confluence of 1965 below:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The very first operating systems were little more "manual operating procedures" for the first computers in the 1950s. These procedures established a queue of jobs waiting to be executed; an operator put the jobs on the machine one by one and returned output to the requesting users. These procedures were soon automated in the late 1950s; IBM's 1401 front end to the IBM 709x number crunchers was the best known of commercial "spooling" systems. From that time on, computer system engineers became interested in automating all aspects of computing including in-execution job scheduling, resource allocation, and user interaction, and pre-execution job design, preparation, testing, and debugging. By 1965, their experiments yielded a set of eight principles that became the starting point for a new generation of operating systems:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interactive computing (time-sharing)</li>
          <li>Hierarchical file systems</li>
          <li>Fault tolerant structures</li>
          <li>Interrupt systems</li>
          <li>Automated overlays (virtual memory)</li>
          <li>Multiprogramming</li>
          <li>Modular programming</li>
          <li>Controlled information sharing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It was after these set of operating system principles were founded, that the foundations for the personal computer industry would get their start. Though PCs still were predominantly made during this time as a way of creating proof of concepts, these machines would lay the groundwork for what was yet to come with the rise of personal computers. For example, during the early 1970’s the K-202 was created in Poland. Though still impractical and overpriced for home users, it featured a programmable architecture, increased memory, and increased processing power, all of which would continue to improve and lead the way to the PC industry.

        </div>
        <p>
          It was also during this period that the Altair 8800 debuted, often considered the first commercially viable home PC. The reasoning for this is assuredly tied to it’s incredibly low price point, as opposed to its capabilities. Nonetheless, it established the market viability of bringing computer kits into the home and paved the way for the next step in the process, one that would invariably cement home PCs as a product of the future.

          <span> Rise of the Trinity </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The year 1977 brought the rise of what Byte magazine later dubbed “The Trinity”, the first set of truly commercially viable home computers. This club included Apple’s Apple II, Commodore’s PET, and Tandy’s TRS-80. The dawn of this trio can not be overemphasized enough. Put succinctly by Paul Ceruzzi in “Inventing the PC”: “There is no linear progression,but rather a series of erratic advances along a number of fronts. To those at MIT, the logical progression of computing was to build better and better large systems, accessible to people by inexpensive termi-nals. The Altair and the Apple 11 short-circuited that process. And when disparate developments converge, as they did in the mid-1970s, things change profoundly and rapidly.” These PCs served as the convergence of all prior advancements that had been made and each brought their own features to the table.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/pictureContent/2560px-Trinity77.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Trinity">
        <p>
          The Apple II first and foremost brought some of the user-friendly features it would later be known for clear back with its first commercially successful device, namely it’s colour graphics and the QWERTY keyboard that came built in with the device.The PET scored points early on in the fact that the machine was truly “all-in-one” with all of its peripherals being built into the machine, including the monitor. The PET also exhibited an early PC trend of being available in differently spec’d models, in this case models with varying memory. Meanwhile, the TRS-80 debatably serves as the best example of a precursor to the modern PC. It’s main features included it’s QWERTY keyboard, it’s ability to be fairly modular, and most importantly, it’s inclusion of Microsoft BASIC, one of the premier early operating systems. Additionally, this PC received a large reach and great sales due to the fact that Tandy owned RadioShack, meaning the PC was ready to be marketed through thousands of stores.

          While these three certainly laid the groundwork, got people interested in PCs and began to reach into the home, it only truly served as a sort of “foot in the door”. PCs were by no means integrated into society at this point and PC sales for all models still were limited to thousands, barely breaking into the millions, and their primary audience was still predominantly enthusiasts. While this served as the business model for the young industry for awhile, everything would change in the 1980’s.

            Rise of OS and GUIs
          </span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The 1980’s did not start off with a bang, though it would start the trends that would land PCs in the homes of personal users. This all began with the Apple Lisa, and extremely expensive and impractical PC released in 1983 by Apple, but one that nonetheless would define the PC for years to come. The Lisa was the first PC to utilize both GUIs, or graphical user interfaces, as well as a mouse, another peripheral used to interact with the GUI on screen. With the release of the Apple Macintosh in the year following, these dreams would come to a more commercially-viable fruition, with greatly increased sales due to Apple’s ability to lower the sticker price. In the ensuing years, these GUIs would become the standard, with other major PC manufacturers integrating them into their system with notable examples like the Amiga.

        <p>
          This time is best described in John Dvorak’s “A Brief History of Personal Computing” where he discusses how this revolution in GUIs set off a battle for control in both the PC and OS markets, with the rise of Microsoft who began developing the early versions of Windows and continued attempts from Apple to grapple for their market share. This period in the late 1980’s serves as another convergence of sorts, as processing units for PCs continued to receive improved performance, Apple’s innovation, and Microsoft’s ability to build operating systems that appealed to business as well as non-business users, resulted in a lurch of what PCs were capable of, as well as their commercial market viability.

        <p>
          I believe it was during this period that the personal computer industry firmly staked its claim to fame and, with its continued development, laid the foundation for PCs to find their way into more than just the homes of enthusiasts. A perfect example of this comes Elizabeth Petrick’s article “Curb Cuts and Computers: Advocating for Design Equality in the 1980’s”. In the article, Petrick discusses how disability advocates were beginning to argue that it was necessary for accessibility features to be integrated and kept in mind when developing computers to allow for greater access. While it can be argued that accessibility would need to be kept in mind for business purposes only, I would argue that this illustrates the true reach computers were starting to achieve. It is at this point that computers were starting to become machines that anyone could and should be able to use, hence the importance of advocates fighting for accessibility to be considered when creating computers.

            The Consequences

        </h2>
        <p>
          It is at this crucial turning point during the late 1980’s and early 1990’s that the PC truly began to take off and be sold on a wide scale to much wider audiences. As per the Computer and Internet Usage report released by the US census bureau in 2017, households that owned a PC in 1989 sat at 17%, and over the ensuing years would increase to 22% in 1993 and 38% by 1997. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As the years waned on, the computer industry would continue to grow into the industry we know it as today, and surely a lot of factors are responsible for this. Processors, storage space, and memory have all continually grown to perform better, PCs have increasingly become more efficient, lowering their overall price tag, and the internet brought on a whole new medium with which we communicate and seek out information. However, GUIs and the foundational refinement of operating systems directly led to the increase to 22% household ownership and played a solid role in the eventual uptick to 38% (though with the dawn of the internet, it can not be said as concretely how large it’s role was). In summation, this means the development of these two cornerstones of modern computers served as the original catalyst for widespread computer ownership and integration of PCs into our daily lives.
